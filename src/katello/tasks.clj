  expecting-error
  "Inverts exception handling. Execute forms, if error is caught
   matching selector, nil is returned. If no error is caught,
   an :success error is thrown. If a non-matching error occurs, the
   exception will not be caught and will propagate up the stack. You
   can still use this even in cases where a success is what you
   expect, just use the selector [:type :success]
   Examples: (expecting-error ArithmeticException (/ 1 0)) -> nil

             (expecting-error ArithmeticException (/ 12 3)) ->
               throws :unexpected-success exception.
